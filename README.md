This code was generated through a mix of Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT 4-o. You may see problems in the code. For anybody who wants to use these tools, I found Claude Sonnet much better at generating the code that I wanted it to. It also was much better at refining the code. However the limits for Claude are more severe compared to ChatGPT.

Requirements:

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Excel or Libreoffice to see the final output in a neat format.

You will need openpyxl to let the code output to the excel sheet. You can install it with "pip install openpyxl" You can remove that and let it output to a random txt file.
